           2*[(a) fix  the minimum  rates of wages payable to employees                 employed in  an employment  specified in Part I or Part                 II of the Schedule and in an employment added to either                 Part by notification under section 27:

 4
                minimum rates  of wages under this clause for the whole 
                State, fix  such rates  for a  part of the State or for                 any specified  class or  classes of  such employment in 
                the whole State or part thereof;]

                necessary: 
        3*[Provided that  where for any reason the appropriate Government  has not  reviewed the minimum rates of wages fixed by it in respect of  any scheduled  employment within  any interval  of five years, nothing 
 contained in  this clause shall be deemed to prevent it from reviewing 
 the minimum  rates after  the expiry  of the said period of five years  and revising  them, if  necessary, and  until they  are so revised the  minimum rates  in force  immediately before  the expiry  of  the  said  period of five years shall continue in force.] 
  
      (1A) Notwithstanding  anything contained  in sub-section (1), the  appropriate Government  may refrain from fixing minimum rates of wages  in respect of any scheduled employment in which there are in the whole  State less than one thousand employees engaged in such employment, but 
 if at any time, 4*** the appropriate  Government  comes  to  a finding 
 after such inquiry as it  may make  or cause to be made in this behalf  that the number of employees  in any  scheduled employment  in respect  of which it has refrained from fixing minimum rates of wages has risen  to one thousand or more, it shall fix minimum rates of  wages  payable 
 to employees in such employment  5*[as  soon  as  may  be  after  such 
 finding].]         (2) The appropriate Government may fix,--

                securing to such employees a minimum rate of wages on a                 time  work   basis  (hereinafter   referred  to  as  "a                 guaranteed time rate");   
           (d) a  minimum rate (whether a time rate or a piece rate) to 
                apply in  substitution for the minimum rate which would                 otherwise be  applicable, in  respect of  overtime work                 done by employees (hereinafter referred to as "overtime                 rate"). 
  
      1*[(2A) Where in respect of an industrial dispute relating to the  rates of wages payable to any of the employees employed in a scheduled  employment, any  proceeding is  pending before  a Tribunal or National  Tribunal under  the Industrial  Disputes Act,  1947 (14  of 1947.)  or

 force, or  an award  made by  any Tribunal,  National Tribunal or such  authority is  in operation,  and a notification fixing or revising the  minimum rates  of wages  in respect  of the  scheduled  employment  is  issued during  the pendency of such proceeding or the operation of the 
 award, then,  notwithstanding anything  contained  in  this  Act,  the 
 minimum rates of wages so fixed or so revised shall not apply to those  employees during the period in which the proceeding is pending and the  award made  therein is  in operation or, as the case may be, where the 
 5
 notification is  issued during  the period  of operation  of an award, 
 during that  period; and where such proceeding or award relates to the  rates  of  wages  payable  to  all  the  employees  in  the  scheduled 
 employment, no  minimum rates  of wages  shall be  fixed or revised in 
 respect of that employment during the said period.]         (3) In  fixing or  revising minimum  rates of  wages  under  this  section,--
