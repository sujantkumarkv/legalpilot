Minister of Minority Affairs
Government of India


Section 109 of the Waqf Act, 1995, as amended, has empower ed the State 
Gover nments to make rules to car ry out the purposes of this Act, other than those of 
Chapter III, and to notify these in the Official Gazette. It was obser ved by my Ministr y 
that many State Gover nments have not notified the rules prescribed under the Act 
including rules relating to new amendments, which were incorporated into the Act 
during 2013. It is pertinent to mention here that the Sachar Committee, which was 
constituted for the study of social, economic and educational status of the Muslim 
community of India, had expressed concer n over non framing of the Waqf Rules by 
large number of States. It was, therefore, decided to frame Model Waqf Rules for 
consideration of States / Uts.
I am happy to announce that this Ministr y has prepared Model Waqf Rules 
under Section 109 of the Waqf Act 1995 (as amended). These rules have been framed 
by this Ministr y not with a view to encroach upon the  powers of the State / UT 
Gover nments, but to  facilitate and guide them for early adoption and notification after 
suitable modifications of these rules. These rules, if adopted, will bring about near 
unifor mity in the proper administration of auqaf in all the States / UTs. I would, 
however , like to reiterate here that these rules are not binding for adoption as a whole 
and the State/UT Gover nments are at liberty to adopt these in toto or with 
amendments as they deem fit.
