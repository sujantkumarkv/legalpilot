as can be performed, and award compensation in money for the deficiency.

contract, the plaintiff may also claim compensation for its breach 1[in addition to ] such performance.  
(2) If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific perf ormance ought not to be granted, but that 
there is a contract between the parties which has been broken by the defendant, and that the plaintiff is 
entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall award him such compensation accordingly.  
(3) If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it is  not 
sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for breach of the contract should 
also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him suc h compensation accordingly.

deposit paid or  1[made by] him, in case his claim for specific performance is refused.  
(2) No relief under clause ( a) or clause ( b) of sub -section ( 1) shall be granted by the court unless it has

be specifically enforced, may be so enforced, though a sum be named in it  as the amount to be paid in case 
of its breach and the party in default is willing to pay the same, if the court, having regard to the terms of 
the contract and other attending circumstances, is satisfied that the sum was named only for the purpose of 
securing performance of the contract and not for the purpose of giving to the party in default an option of 
paying money in lieu of specific performance.  
(2) When enforcing specific performance under this section, the court shall no t also decree payment of 
the sum so named in the contract.  
24. Bar of suit for compensation for breach after dismissal of suit for specific performance .The 
dismissal of a suit for  specific performance of a contract or part thereof shall bar the plaintiff s right to sue 
for compensation for the breach of such contract or  part, as the case may be, but shall not bar his right to 
sue for any other relief to which he may be enti tled, by reason of such breach.  
ENFORCEMENT OF AWARDS AND DIRECTIONS TO EXECUTE SETTLEMENTS  
25. Application of preceding sections to certain awards and testamentary directions to execute 
settlements .The provisions of this Chapter as to contracts shall apply to awards to which 2[the Arbitra tion 
and Conciliation Act, 1996  (26 of 1996) ], does not apply and to directions in a will or codicil to execute a 
particular settlement.  
CHAPTER III  
RECTIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS  
26. When instrument may be rectified .(1) When, through fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties , 
a contract or other instrument  in writing [not being the articles of association of a company to which the 
Companies Act, 1956  (1 of 1956) , applies ] does not express their  real intention, then  
(a) either party or his representative in interest may institute a suit to have th e instrument rectified; 
or 
(b) the plaintiff may, in any suit in which any right arising under the instrument is in issue, claim 
in his pleading that  the instrument be rectified; or  
(c) a defendant in any such suit as is referred to in clause ( b), may, in addition to any other defence 
open to him, ask  for rectification of the instrument.  
(2) If, in any suit in which a contract or other  instrument is sought to be rectified under                   sub-
section ( 1), the court finds that the instrumen t, through fraud or mistake, does not express the real intention 
of the parties, the court may , in its discretion, direct rectification  of the instrument so as to express that 
intention, so far as this can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third per sons in good faith and 
for value . 
(3) A contract in writing may first be rectified, and then if the party claiming rectification has so prayed 
in his pleading and the court  thinks fit, may be specifically enforced.  
                                                           
1. Subs. by Act 52 of 1964, s. 3 and  the Second Schedule,  for made to (w.e.f. 29 -12-1964).  
2. Subs. by Act 18 of 2018, s. 12 , for the Arbitration Act, 1940 (10 of 1940)  (w.e.f. 1-10-2018 ). 
12 
 (4) No relief for the rectificat ion of an instrument shall be granted to any party under this section unless 
it has been specifically claimed:  
Provided that where a party has not claimed any such relief in his pleading, the court shall, at any stage 
of the proceeding, allow him  to amend the pleading on such terms as may be just for including such claim.  
CHAPTER IV  
RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS  
27. When rescission may be adjudged or refused .(1) Any person interested in a contract may sue 
to have it rescinded, and  such rescission may be adjudged by the court in any of the following cases, 
namely:  
(a) where the contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff;  
(b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face and the defendant is more to 
blame than the plaintiff.  
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub -section ( 1), the court may refuse to rescind the 
contract  
(a) where the plaintiff has expressly or impliedly ratified the contract; or  
(b) where, owing to the change of circumstances whi ch has taken place since the making of the 
contract (not being due to any act of the defendant himself), the parties cannot be substantially restored 
to the position in which they stood when the contract was made; or  
(c) where third parties have, during th e subsistence of the contract, acquired rights in good faith 
without notice and for value; or  
(d) where only a part of the contract is sought to be rescinded and such part is not severable from 
the rest of the contract.  
Explanation .In this section contract  in relation to the territories to which the Transfer of Property 
Act, 1882  (4 of 1882) , does not  extend, means a contract in writing.  
28. Rescission in certain circumstances of contracts for the sale or lease of immovable property, 
the specific p erformance of which has been decreed .(1) Where in any suit a decree for specific 
performance of a contract for the sale or lease of immovable property  has been made and the purchaser or 
lessee does not, within the period allowed by the decree or such further period as the  court may allow, pay  
the purchase money or other sum which the court has ordered him to pay, the vendor or lessor may apply 
in the  same suit in which the decree is made, to have the contract rescinded and on such application the 
court may, by order, rescind the  contract either so far as regards the party in default or altogether, as the 
justice of the case may require.  
(2) Where a contr act is rescinded under sub -section ( 1), the court  
(a) shall direct the purchaser or the lessee, if he has obtained possession of the property under the 
contract, to restore such pos session to the vendor or lessor, and 
(b) may direct payment to the vendor or lessor of all the rents and profits which have accrued in 
respect of the property from the date on which possession was so obtained by the purchaser or lessee 
until restoration of  possession to the vendor or lessor, and , if the justice of the case so re quires, the 
refund of any sum paid by  the vendee or the lessee as earnest money or deposit in connection with the 
contract.  
(3) If the purchase or lessee pays the purchase  money or other sum which he is ordered to pay under 
the decree within the  period referred to in sub -section ( 1), the court may, on application made in the same 
suit, award the purchaser or lessee such further  relief as he may be entitled to, including in appropriate cases 
all or any of the following reliefs, namely:  
(a) the execution of a proper conveyance or lease by the vendor or lessor;  
13 
 (b) the delivery of possession, or partition and separate possession, of the property on the execution 
of such convey ance or lease.  
(4) No separate suit in respect of any relief which may be claimed under this section shall lie at the 
instance of a vendor, purchaser, lessor or lessee, as the case may be.  
(5) The costs of any proceedings under this section shall be in the  discretion of the court.  
29. Alternative prayer for rescission in suit for specific performance .A plaintiff instituting a suit 
for the specific  performance of a contract in writing may pray in the alternative that, if the contract cannot 
be specifically enforced, it may be  rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled; and the court, if it refuses to 
enforce the contract specifically, may direct it to be rescinded and delivered up accordingly.  
30. Court may require parties rescinding to do equity .On adjudging the rescission of a contract, 
the court may require the  party to whom such relief is granted to restore, so far as may be, any benefit which 
he may have received from the other party and to  make any compensation to him which justice may require.  
CHAPTER V  
CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS  
31. When cancellation may be ordered .(1) Any person against whom a written instrument is void 
or voidable, and who  has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him 
serious injury, ma y sue to have it adjudged  void or voidable; and the court may, in its discretion, so adjudge 
it and order it to be delivered up and cancelled.  
(2) If the instrument has been registered under the Indian Registration Act, 1908  (16 of 1908) , the court 
shall also send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has been so registered; and 
such officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of its cancellation.  
32. What instruments may be partially cancel led.Where an instrument is evidence of different 
rights or different obligations, the court may, in a proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the 
residue.  
33. Power to require benefit to be restored or compensation to be made when instrum ent is 
cancelled or is successfully resisted as being void or voidable .(1) On adjudging the cancellation of an 
instrument, the court may require the party to whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as may be any 
benefit which he may have received from the other party and to make any compensation  to him which  
justice may require.  
(2) Where a defendant successfully resists any suit on the ground  
(a) that the instrument sough t to be enforced against him in the suit is voidable, the court may if 
the d efendant has received  any benefit under the instrument from the other party, require him to restore, 
so far as may be, such benefit to that party or to make compensation for it;  
(b) that the agreement sought to be enforced against him in the suit is void by reason of his not 
having been competent to contract under section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872  (9 of 1872) , the 
court may, if the defendant has received any benefit under the agreement from the other party, require 
him to restore, so far as may b e, such  benefit to that party, to the extent to which he or his estate has 
benefited thereby . 
CHAPTER VI  
DECLARATORY DECREES  
34. Discretion of court as to declaration of status or right .Any person entitled to any legal 
character, or to any right as  to any  property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested 
to deny, his title to such character or right, and the  court may in its discretion make therein a declaration 
that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need  not in such suit ask for any further relief:  
Provided that no court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek further 
relief than a mere  declaration of title, omits to do so.  
14 
 Explanation. A trustee of property is a person interested to deny  a title adverse to the title of some 
one who is not inexistence, and for whom, if in existence, he would be a trustee.  
35. Effect of declaration .A declaration made under this Chapter is binding only on the parties to the 
suit, persons claiming through them respec tively, and, where any of the parties are trustees, on the persons 
for whom, if in existence at the date of the declaration, such parties would be trustees.  
 
PART III  
PREVENTIVE RELIEF  
CHAPTER VII  
INJUNCTIONS GENERALLY  
36. Preventive relief how granted .Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the court by 
injunction, temporary or  perpetual.  
37. Temporary and perpetual injunctions .(1) Temporary injunctions are such as are to continue 
until a specific time, or until the further order of the court , and they may  be granted at any stage of a suit, 
and are regulated by the  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908  (5 of 1908) . 
(2) A perpetual injunction can only be granted by the decree made at the hearing and upon the merits 
of the suit; the defendant is thereby  perpetually enjoined from the assertion of a right, or from the 
commission of an act, which would be contrary to the rights of the plaintiff.  
CHAPTER VIII  
PERPETUAL INJUNCTIONS  
38. Perpetual injunction when granted .(1) Subject to the other provisions contained in or referred 
to by this Chapter, a  perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an 
obligation existing in his favour, whether expressly  or by implication.  
(2) When any such obli gation arises from contract, the court shall be guided by the rules and provisions 
contained in  Chapter II.  
(3) When the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff s right to, or enjoyment of,  property, 
the court may  grant a perpetual injunctio n in the following cases, namely:  
(a) where the defendant is trustee of the property for the plaintiff;  
(b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused, 
by the invasion;  
(c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not afford adequate relief;  
(d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings.  
39. Mandatory injunctions .When, to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel 
the per formance of certain acts which the court is capable of enforcing, the court may in its discretion grant 
an injunction to prevent the breach complained of , and also to compel performance of the requisite acts.  
40. Damages in lieu of, or in addition to, injunction .(1) The plaintiff in a suit for perpetual 
injunction under section 38, or  mandatory injunction  under section 39, may claim damages either in 
addition to, or in substitution for, such injunction and the court may,  if it thinks fit, award such damages.  
(2) No relief for damages shall be granted under this section unless the plaintiff has claimed such  relief 
in his plaint:  
Provided that where no such damages have been claimed in the plaint, the court shall, at any stage of 
the proceedings, allow the plaintiff to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including such 
claim.  
(3) The dismissal o f a suit to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favour of the plaintiff shall 
bar his right to sue for  damages for such breach.  
15 
 41. Injunction when refused .An injunction cannot be granted  
(a) to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial  proceeding pending at the institution of the 
suit in which the injunction is sought, unless such restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of 
proceedings;  
(b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a court not             sub-
ordinate to that from  which the injunction is sought;  
(c) to restrain any person from applying to any legislative body;  
(d) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a criminal matter;  
(e) to prevent the breach of  a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced;  
(f) to prevent, on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that it will be a 
nuisance;  
(g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has acquies ced; 
(h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by any other usual mode of proceeding 
except in case  of breach of trust;  
1[(ha) if it would impede or delay the progress or completion of any infrastructure project  or 
interfere with the co ntinued provision of relevant facility related thereto or services  being the s ubject 
matter of such project.]  
(i) when the conduct of the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to disentitle him to be the 
assistance of the court;  
(j) when the plaintiff has no personal interest in the matter.  
42. Injunction to perform negative  agreement .Notwithstanding anything contained in clause ( e) 
of section 41, where a  contract comprises an affirmative agreement to do a certain act, coupled with a 
negative agreement , express or implied, not to do a  certain act, the circumstance that the court is unable to 
compel specific performance of the affirmative agreement shall not preclude  it from granting an injunction 
to perform the negative agreement:  
Provided that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the contract so far as it is binding on him.
